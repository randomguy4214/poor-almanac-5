combining fundamentals of companies and latest prices into one excel output. 
goal is to compare fundamentals with the market.

Designed in PyCharm, but will work anywhere. The code relies on yahoo_fin to get the data and pandas to process it.  

1. Run "main.py" to loop through all the scripts
2. If error, install pandas, yahoo_fin
3. It runs incredibly slow (few days prob), because yahoo is blocking too many requests. And the code aims to get as much as possible.
4. You need to manually delete temp folders to update.
